---

## Dashboard Connection

1. Navigate to the Buckets section in your ApexxCloud dashboard
2. Click "Create Bucket"
3. Enable "Use external bucket (BYOB)"
4. Fill in the required details:
   - External Bucket Type:
     - AWS S3
     - Cloudflare R2
     - DigitalOcean Spaces
   - Access Key
   - Secret Access Key
   - External Bucket Name
   - Region

<Note>
  We only need read access to your bucket. Make sure you have the necessary
  permissions set up in your cloud provider.
</Note>

## Usage

Once connected:

- Use ApexxCloud's transformation features and CDN with files in your bucket
- All file operations (upload, delete, etc.) must be done directly through your storage provider
- Original files remain in your bucket
- Transformed versions are managed by ApexxCloud

### Example URLs

Original S3 URL:

```
https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/photo.jpg
```

New ApexxCloud URL (with transformations):

```
https://cdn.apexxcloud.com/f/{access_id}/tr-w_500,h_300/images/photo.jpg
```

You should use the same object key from your original bucket.

## Required Permissions

Your bucket policy must include:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
