## Overview

ApexxCloud provides powerful cloud storage and media transformation capabilities. This guide will help you get started with:

- Setting up your SDK
- Uploading your first file
- Applying transformations
- Connecting external storage (optional)

<Note>
  Already have an S3, R2, or Spaces bucket? You can connect your existing bucket
  to use our transformation and CDN features while keeping your files in your
  own storage. [Learn more about connecting your
  bucket](/integrations-and-migrations/connect-your-s3-bucket).
</Note>

## Installation

Choose the SDK that best fits your needs:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @apexxcloud/sdk-node    # For Node.js
npm install @apexxcloud/sdk-js      # For browser

## Quick Setup

### Node.js

```javascript
const ApexxCloud = require("@apexxcloud/sdk-node");

const storage = new ApexxCloud({
  accessKey: "your-access-key",
  secretKey: "your-secret-key",
  region: "APAC",
  bucket: "default-bucket",
});
```

### Browser

```javascript
import ApexxCloud from "@apexxcloud/sdk-js";

const storage = new ApexxCloud({
  baseUrl: "https://api.apexxcloud.com",
});
```

### React

```tsx
import { useApexxCloud } from "@apexxcloud/react";
import { useRef, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const { upload, uploadMultipart } = useApexxCloud();

  //...
}
```

The `useApexxCloud` hook provides:
