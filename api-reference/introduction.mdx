## Welcome

You can use our api reference to integrate the api's directly in your own applications.

<Note>
  If you want sdk support for languages that is not supported yet, please
  [contact us](support@apexxcloud.com) so we can add it.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. You'll need to obtain your API credentials (Access Key and Secret Key) from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.apexxcloud.com/signup).

### Required Headers

Each request must include the following authentication headers:

| Header         | Description                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `X-Access-Key` | Your API Access Key                   |
| `X-Signature`  | HMAC SHA-256 signature of the request |
| `X-Timestamp`  | ISO 8601 timestamp of the request     |

### Signature Generation

The signature is generated by creating an HMAC SHA-256 hash of the following string:

```
{HTTP_METHOD}\n{PATH}\n{TIMESTAMP}
```

Example JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
const generateSignature = (
  method,
  path,
  timestamp = new Date().toISOString()
) => {
  const stringToSign = `${method}\n${path}\n${timestamp}`;
  const signature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secretKey)
    .update(stringToSign)
    .digest("hex");

  return { signature, timestamp };
};
```
